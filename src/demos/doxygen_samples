/** \page example_delayedcreation Example: Delayed creation of an OffscreenGecko object in C++
 * In C++, an instance of the wrapped object type is created immediately when 
 * the wrapper class is constructed. Delayed creation is still possible, 
 * though: for that, the wrapper must be initialized with a <i>null reference</i>. 
 * Later, a new instance of the wrapper type for the desired object can be assigned. 
 * \code
 * // Initializes as a "null reference"
 * OSGK::Browser myBrowser (OSGK::Browser::Null());
 *
 * // ... do other stuff ...
 *
 * // Now actually create an object
 * myBrowser = OSGK::Browser (...);
 * \endcode

/**
 * \page example_web2image Example: Render web page to image file
 * This is a simple application that renders a web page to a memory buffer
 * and writes that to disk.
 *
 * (OSGK::TGAWriter is an OffscreenGecko-internal class; but the image 
 * writing is not the point of the example anyway.)
