BUILDING OFFSCREENGECKO FOR WINDOWS

Prerequisites:
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 SP 1:
    "Official" builds of XULrunner are built with this compiler. Since
    OffscreenGecko directly uses some methods from the XULrunner libraries
    implemented in C++ it's a good idea to match the compilers used for 
    XULrunner and OffscreenGecko here. The Express Edition is sufficient to
    build.
  
  - cmake:
    To generate project files (as they depend on local paths). At least cmake 2.6
    is required.
  
  - A build of Gecko 1.9:
    This can either be the pre-built XULrunner SDK or a customized version
    built from the mozilla.org sources.

Generating projects:
  If you have all of the above you need to build the MSVC project files for
  OffscreenGecko. This is done by the "generate-projects.cmd" batch file.
  
  To build OffscreenGecko correctly the location of the Gecko 1.9 build must
  be known:
   * If you obtained a pre-built XULrunner SDK you can extract it to the
     "xulrunner-sdk" directory of the OffscreenGecko source tree. The batch
     will default to that location.
   * If you already have a pre-built XULrunner SDK, but at some different
     location, you can specify the path like this:
       generate-projects.cmd -DXULRUNNER_SDK_DIR=<path-to-xulrunner-sdk>
   * If you custom-built a mozilla.org application, you can point to 
     "dist" subdirectory of the build directory as the "XULrunner SDK
     directory".

Actually building OffscreenGecko:
  If the prerequisites are met and the projects are generated open the solution
  up in Visual Studio and hit "Build".
