BUILDING OFFSCREENGECKO FOR LINUX

Prerequisites:
 - Compiler, of course. You may have to install extra packages on some
   distros for that.
   
  - cmake:
    The build system used for OffscreenGecko. At least cmake 2.6 is required.
  
 - A build of Gecko 1.9:
   This can either be the pre-built XULrunner SDK, a version that ships with
   your or a customized version built from the mozilla.org sources.
   Note that building against the version from your distro may mean that
   OffscreenGecko does not work on other distros. For maximum compatibility
   I recommend using a pre-built SDK and shipping the binaries from that with
   your app.
   
Actually building OffscreenGecko:
  Run 'cmake' to generate Makefiles, run 'make' to do the building itself.
  Currently, the application linking will result in a number of warnings for
  unresolved symbols. These can be ignored.

Caveat:
  Main Linux development is done on Gentoo; OffscreenGecko works & builds there
  with the distro-supplied XULrunner. For other distros YMMV.
